# 🧬 Type 2 Diabetes Detection and Awareness Web App

An intelligent health-focused web application designed to detect **Type 2 Diabetes risk** based on user symptoms and risk factors using machine learning, and provide 24/7 guidance via a built-in **AI health chatbot**. Developed using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and **HTML/CSS/JS** for the frontend.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

This web app helps users:
- Assess their risk of developing **Type 2 Diabetes** using a data-driven prediction model.
- Access **educational content** about the disease, its symptoms, prevention, and lifestyle changes.
- Interact with a **health chatbot** that answers frequently asked questions and offers personalized health tips.

The goal is to increase early awareness and proactive self-monitoring, especially in under-resourced or high-risk communities.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧪 **Diabetes Risk Prediction**  
  Users answer a short questionnaire and receive an instant risk score based on a trained machine learning model.

- 🤖 **Health Chatbot (AI Assistant)**  
  Ask the chatbot anything about diabetes, symptoms, healthy living, diet tips, and more.

- 📚 **Informative Sections**  
  Learn about causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and prevention strategies for Type 2 Diabetes.

- 🌐 **Multi-language Support (Planned)**  
  Future support for local languages like **Luganda** and **Lutoro** for wider reach.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python (Flask)
- **ML Model:** Trained using scikit-learn or TensorFlow (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree)
- **Database (Optional):** SQLite or JSON for storing user queries (if needed)
- **Bot Integration:** Custom rule-based or AI-powered Q&A system (e.g., Rasa, GPT-3.5, or keyword matching)

---

## 🧠 How the Detection Works

1. User enters responses to a health survey (age, weight, glucose level, activity, etc.).
2. Data is passed to a **pre-trained ML model**.
3. The model predicts the likelihood of Type 2 Diabetes.
4. The user receives a result with interpretation and recommendations.
